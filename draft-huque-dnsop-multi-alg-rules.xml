      <t>
        This document restates the requirements on DNSSEC signing and
        validation and makes small adjustments in order to allow for
        more flexible handling of configurations that
        advertise multiple Secure Entry Points (SEP) with different
        signing algorithms via their DS record or trust anchor set.
        The adjusted rules allow both for multi-signer
        operation and for the transfer of signed DNS zones between providers,
        where the providers support disjoint DNSSEC algorithm sets.
        In addition, the proposal enables pre-publication of a trust
        anchor in preparation for an algorithm rollover, such as of the
        root zone.

    <section title="Introduction and Motivation" anchor="intro">
      <t>
        The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
        <xref target="RFC4033" /> <xref target="RFC4034" />
        <xref target="RFC4035" /> add data origin authentication
        and integrity protection to the Domain Name System (DNS),
        by having DNS zone owners (or their operators) crytographically
        sign their zone data.
      </t>
      <t>
        Current specifications <xref target="RFC4035" /><xref target="RFC6840" />
        require that a zone be signed with each signing algorithm listed
        in a zone's DS RRset or appearing via its trust anchors (TAs).
        This poses a problem in (at least) the following situations:
      </t>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <t>
            In multi-signer setups (<xref target="RFC8901">Multi-Signer
            Extensions</xref> Section 2.1.2), multiple providers using
            distinct DNSSEC keys can cooperatively serve the same DNS zone.
            This method does not work however if the providers
            involved employ different DNSSEC algorithms.
          </t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>
            <xref target="DNSSEC-AUTO">DNSSEC Automation</xref> further
            describes how to fully automate multi-signer operations, including
            how to use a transitional state of a multi-signer configuration
            to non-disruptively transfer a signed zone from one provider to
            another. If the old and the new provider do not use the same
            signing algorithms, the same problem is encountered.
          </t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>
            When performing an algorithm rollover for a zone with a trust
            anchor, current specifications mandate that the zone has to be
            double-signed with both the old and the new algorithm before
            publishing the new trust anchor.
          </t>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <t>
                  This implies that it is not possible to independently change the
                  algorithms of the SEP key and other DNSKEYs; however, depending on
                  local circumstances, an operator might find such an approach more
                  desirable than simultaneously duplicating all keys for the new
                  algorithm. For example, a zone could roll the KSK from algorithm 8
                  to algorithm 13 without changing the ZSK, and later roll the ZSK.
                </t>
              </li>
              <li>
                <t>
                  For the root zone, the current rules could
                  lead to a potentially rather long phase of double-signing (on the
                  order of a year). As this comes with both financial and operational
                  risks, it seems desirable to find a way for publishing the new trust
                  anchor without introducing the new algorithm into the zone just yet.
                </t>
              </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>
            Furthermore, for online signers, producing on the fly signatures
            for several algorithms imposes a significant computational burden.
          </t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        The above issues are not just a theoretical problem. Real situations in
        the field have occurred where the existing requirements have posed an
        obstacle to DNSSEC deployment and operations.
      </t>
      <t>
        That said, the existing signing requirements 
        are well motivated: When a zone's DS RRset or
        trust anchor set includes multiple DNSKEY algorithms, an attacker who
        can strip all the supported RRSIGs from a signed response from that
        zone, leaving just the unsupported signatures, must not be able to
        disable validation for that zone, effectively downgrading the zone to
        "insecure". The rules therefore ensure the downgrade resistance of
        DNSSEC when only some, but not all, of a zone's DS RRset or trust
        anchor set DNSKEY algorithms are supported by a validating resolver.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document proposes modifications to the IANA signing algorithm registry and
        minor modifications of the signing and validation rules
        to accommodate additional use cases, without compromising
        the security guarantees given by DNSSEC.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Proposed Updates to RFCs" anchor="updates">
      <t>
        The heart of the issue is that even though any one acceptable signature
        suffices for validation, the signer cannot, in the general case,
        know which particular signing algorithm(s) the validator will support;
        and hence, providing a "large enough set" (read: all of them) is the
        approach that had been taken so far.
      </t>
      <t>
        This is set down in Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC4035" />:
      </t>
      <blockquote>
        There MUST be an RRSIG for each RRset using at least one DNSKEY
        of each algorithm in the zone apex DNSKEY RRset. The apex DNSKEY
        RRset itself MUST be signed by each algorithm appearing in the DS
        RRset located at the delegating parent (if any).
      </blockquote>
      <t>
        This document advocates that signers adopt a more liberal
        approach to the requirement of signatures by algorithm sets
        when zones employ suitably strong and well known algorithms.
        It precisely defines which algorithms are safe to use
        in this way, and additionally places some of the burden on
        validating resolvers to ensure this safety.
      </t>

      <t>
        The approach establishes a mechanism allowing the signer to determine
        which RRSIGs can be skipped, without risking validation failures. It
        does not require all algorithms' RRSIGs to be present, while ensuring
        that the set of signatures provided is still "large enough" for
        reliable DNSSEC operation, so that robust multi-signer operation
        and TA pre-publication are made possible, without risking validation
        failures.
      </t>
      <t>
        For the case of a multi-signer setup with two generally supported
        algorithms (such as 8 and 13), the scheme requires only one of the two
        signatures. Similarly, when pre-publishing a trust anchor, associated
        signatures don't need to be published immediately, provided that the
        existing TA's algorithm is generally supported.
      </t>

      <section title="Updates to RFC 8624">
        <t>
          The notion of UNIVERSAL signing algorithms is introduced, and
          defined as follows:
        </t>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <t>
              The information contained in the table of
              <xref target="RFC8624" /> Section 3.1 is transferred into a
              to-be-erected IANA registry, and a boolean column is added with
              the heading "universal validation support". Signing algorithms
              where this column is TRUE are called "UNIVERSAL".
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
              "MUST validate" is a prerequisite for UNIVERSAL. Changes that
              affect whether an algorithm is UNIVERSAL require standards
              action.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
              Algorithms 8 and 13 are the only algorithms initially declared
              UNIVERSAL.
            </t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          Also, the notion of FORMERLY UNIVERSAL signing algorithms is
          introduced:
        </t>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <t>
              As soon as a UNIVERSAL algorithm is known or expected to have
              declining validation support, it should be moved to FORMERLY
              UNIVERSAL.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
              Algorithms 5 and 7 are the only algorithms initially declared
              FORMERLY UNIVERSAL.
              [ TODO Were 1, 3, 6, 12 ever universally supported? ]

        </section>
        <section title="Signer Requirements">
          <ol>
            <li>
              Absent any UNIVERSAL algorithms in the DS RRset or trust anchor
              set, or when any FORMERLY UNIVERSAL algorithms are present,
              signers MUST sign with all algorithms listed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Otherwise, signers MUST sign with at least one UNIVERSAL algorithm
              listed in the DS RRset or trust anchor set. Other signatures are
              OPTIONAL.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <t>
            UNIVERSAL and FORMERLY UNIVERSAL algorithms SHOULD NOT appear
            together in a DS RRset or trust anchor set. In fact, FORMERLY
            UNIVERSAL algorithms are best avoided: signers SHOULD transition
            to other algorithms that are UNIVERSAL.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Validator Requirements">
          <ol>
            <li>
              When the DS RRset or trust anchor set for a zone includes an
              unsupported FORMERLY UNIVERSAL algorithm, validators MUST treat
              the zone as unsigned, even if the DS RRset or trust anchor set
              lists another supported algorithm.
            </li>
            <li>
              Otherwise, validators MUST accept any valid path.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <t>
            Implementing these rules requires validators to keep a record of
            unsupported FORMERLY UNIVERSAL algorithms, so that the zone's security
            status can be established upon inspection of a DS record or TA set.
          </t>
          <t>
            Any UNIVERSAL algorithms that a validator supports by default but are disabled on
            the validator as a matter of local policy SHOULD also be considered FORMERLY
            UNIVERSAL unless explicitly configured as "unsupported".  The choice
            should be made with care.  Disabling an algorithm to FORMERLY UNIVERSAL downgrades
            zones signed with the disabled algorithm, while disabling it as "unsupported"
            risks making some zones "bogus", if it was used as the only signing algorithm
            by one of the signers in a multi-signer, multi-algorithm setup.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Discussion">
          <t>
            It is observed that validators need only to know the concept of
            "FORMERLY UNIVERSAL"; knowledge of which algorithms are UNIVERSAL is
            not required. This limits the implementation effort.
          </t>
          <t>
            The new validation requirements enable stable multi-signer setups
            using UNIVERSAL algorithms as well as robust provider
            transfers and algorithm upgrades from FORMERLY UNIVERSAL to UNIVERSAL
            algorithms (such as algorithm 7 to 13), without risking SERVFAIL
            responses in the event that a validator no longer supports one of
            the algorithms (e.g. 7). For a detailed discussion, see
            <xref target="Security">Security Considerations</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            DNS operators in a multi-signer setup are free to limit their
            responses to serve signatures for one UNIVERSAL algorithm only.
            This one signature is sufficient to provide a valid path everywhere.
          </t>
          <t>
            When a UNIVERSAL algorithm is in use, signatures of other
            algorithms are not required. DNS providers are thus free to
            introduce additional algorithms (which were never UNIVERSAL) without
            forcing other participating providers to do the same.
          </t>
          <t>
            When trust anchors are in use for a zone and there is one with a
            UNIVERSAL algorithm, it is permissible to introduce a new trust
            anchor for a different algorithm before introducing the
            corresponding DNSKEY and RRSIGs into the zone. (Of course, they
            need to be added before the old trust anchor is removed.)
          </t>
          <t>
            If the added trust anchor is also for a UNIVERSAL algorithm, it is
            permissible to eventually switch to returning just the RRSIGs for
            the new algorithm, without an intermediate dual-signing period.  If
            the new trust anchor is not yet UNIVERSAL, a dual signing period is
            required in order to complete the algorithm rollover.
          </t>
          <t>
            In typical cases, particularly in the case of the root zone, both
            algorithms will be UNIVERSAL. In a hypothetical emergency situation
            where only the new algorithm is UNIVERSAL and the old was just
            downgraded to FORMERLY UNIVERSAL, the new signatures would need to be
            introduced immediately.  A short dual signing period would then be
            required for continuity.  Validators would be expected to defer
            disabling the old algorithm until after the root zone rollover is
            completed.

    <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="IANA">
      <t>
        TODO: this section will need to be updated to describe the
        construction of the new IANA registry for the implementation status
        and requirements of DNSSEC signing algorithms.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
        <t>
          The new validation requirements presume that zones using multiple
          algorithms are either in a state of transition (e.g. when switching
          providers) or in a permanent multi-provider configuration. In the
          first case, if the outgoing algorithm is not supported by the
          validator, the zone would have been treated as insecure before the
          transition. For the second case, it is noted that the purpose of
          multi-provider setups is to provide resilience against any single
          provider's failure. Consequently, the zone owner is assumed to
          consider the security guarantees given by any single provider to be
          acceptable for the whole zone. By implication, if one of the providers
          has fallen behind and is signing with an algorithm that is no longer
          supported by some resolvers (and thus promises no security), there is
          no guarantee of DNSSEC security for the zone.
        </t>
        <t>
          In other words, the validation requirements guarantee that a zone in a
          multi-provider setup has the same security level as if all but one of
          the involved providers would be unavailable. Consequently, when the
          configuration involves an algorithm that is no longer universally
          supported, non-supporting validators may treat the zone as insecure.
          This resolves undue SERVFAIL issues that could occur with certain
          algorithm combinations under the previous rules.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, a zone using only algorithm 7 is treated as insecure
          by validators that do not support this algorithm. (This is as before.)
          When transferring the domain to another provider via a multi-signer
          setup with algorithm 13, however, the zone's security status will now
          remain "insecure", as the DS RRset still includes FORMERLY UNIVERSAL
          algorithm 7. The presence of algorithm 13 is inconsequential at this
          point. Only once algorithm 7 is removed, the zone turns secure.
        </t>
        <t>
          This rule acknowledges the fact that the signer is using a FORMERLY
          UNIVERSAL algorithm that SHOULD NOT be used for signing, which might
          render the zone insecure for validators that lack support. This
          prevents validation breakage when the validator encounters an
          unsupported RRSIG from an outdated algorithm, and allows for
          glitch-free algorithm upgrades with the security status of the zone
          changing only once the transition is complete.

        <t>
          Validators supporting both algorithms retain security
          throughtout the transition. In case of a permanent multi-signer setup,
          the zone maintainer needs to move from the FORMERLY UNIVERSAL
          algorithm to a UNIVERSAL one in order to restore universal validation.
        </t>
        <section title="Time Dependency of UNIVERSAL Algorithms">
        <t>
          The same situation occurs when an algorithm is removed from the set of
          UNIVERSAL algorithms. In this case, the algorithm will become FORMERLY
          UNIVERSAL. If the zone continues to use the FORMERLY UNIVERSAL
          algorithm, it will continue to be accepted by supporting
          validators, while non-supporting validators will treat the zone
          as insecure until the algorithm is replaced.
        </t>
        <t>
          Conversely, when an algorithm is added to the set of UNIVERSAL ones,
          signers MAY begin to return signatures for just that algorithm. This
          is, in fact, not a problem, as validators do not need to know the
          concept of UNIVERSAL; they just need to support that algorithm (or,
          typically, explicitly classify it as FORMERLY UNIVERSAL). A problem could only
          occur if the corresponding RRSIG was not supported by a non-negligible
          population of validators; however, in that case labeling the algorithm
          as UNIVERSAL would have been premature. Determining universal support
          cannot be solved on the protocol level, and it is the community's
          responsibility to only advance an algorithm to UNIVERSAL when safe
          enough, i.e. when the population of validators lacking support is
          deemed negligible.
        </t>
        <!--<t>
          In any case, regardless of "who moves first", resolution is never
          disrupted, and changes to the set of UNIVERSAL algorithms will not
          trigger overly conservative SERVFAIL responses.
        </t>-->
        <t>
          Validators dropping support for FORMERLY UNIVERSAL algorithms (e.g. 7) without
          implementing this specification will produce SERVFAIL responses for
          multi-signer setups involving the disabled algorithm. Implementation
          of the new validation rules is thus advised as soon as support for an
          algorithm is dropped.

        <section title="Variable Key Size Algorithms">
          <t>
            Since algorithm 8 supports variable key sizes, multi-signer
            configurations involving 8 and 13 should take care to employ
            an RSA keylength that is computationally infeasible to attack.

    <section title="Current Multiple Algorithm Rules" anchor="multialg">
      <t>
        This section discusses the multi-algorithm requirements on signers and
        validators, as specified by the original DNSSEC specification and in
        effect until updated by this document. It is included for purely
        informational purposes and context.
      </t>
      <section title="Signing Requirements">
        <t>
           In addition to the last paragraph of <xref target="RFC4035" />
           Section 2.2 quoted earlier, Section 5.11 of
           <xref target="RFC6840" /> clarifies:
        </t>
        <blockquote>
          A signed zone MUST include a DNSKEY for each algorithm present in
          the zone's DS RRset and expected trust anchors for the zone.
        </blockquote>
        <t>
          While it might seem tempting, relaxing this rule without any further
          adjustments may not be safe depending on the algorithm combination
          involved. In particular, when using an algorithm that is not
          universally supported among the resolver population (such as
          algorithm 7) together with a supported one (such as algorithm 13),
          resolvers may return SERVFAIL under certain circumstances. Zone
          owners and signers thus would have to take great care to not leave a
          validating resolver without a valid supported path in such
          situations, e.g. when transitioning from algorithm 7 to 13.
        </t>
        <t>
          More explicitly, when the sole signing algorithm used by a zone is
          not supported by a given resolver, the resolver will (correctly)
          treat that zone as unsigned. However, when attempting to transfer the
          domain to another DNS provider through a multi-signer setup with a
          supported algorithm, affected resolvers presented with the unsupported
          signature only will not be able to distinguish this situation from a
          downgrade-to-insecure attack where the second signature has been
          stripped, and will return SERVFAIL.
        </t>
        <t>
          Although unstated in that document, the above rule prevents this kind
          of downgrade-to-insecure attack by requiring RRSIGs for all
          advertised algorithms; a validator can thus assume that something is
          wrong when supported signatures are missing.
          As a side effect, the rule also protects against downgrade-to-weaker
          attacks, where an attacker would strip away signatures from signed DNS
          responses and only attach one for an algorithm that the attacker is
          able to forge. This
          property is not a core guarantee of DNSSEC (see below).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Validator Requirements">
        <t>
          In general, when a validating resolver supporting any of the
          algorithms listed in a given zone's DS record or TA set responds to a
          query without the CD flag set, it may not treat that zone as
          insecure, but must return either validated data (AD=1) or RCODE=2
          (SERVFAIL). For this purpose, any valid path suffices; the validator
          may not apply a "logical AND" approach to all advertised algorithms.
        </t>
        <t>
          Accordingly, Section 5.11 of <xref target="RFC6840">DNSSEC
          Clarifications</xref> states:
        </t>
        <blockquote>
          This requirement applies to servers, not validators. Validators
          SHOULD accept any single valid path. They SHOULD NOT insist that all
          algorithms signaled in the DS RRset work, and they MUST NOT insist
          that all algorithms signaled in the DNSKEY RRset work.
        </blockquote>
        <t>
          At first glance, the assertions that (1) the signer provide
          signatures for all advertised algorithms while (2) the resolver shall
          be content with just one seems somewhat contradictory. However, the
          role of the RRSIG rules is to ensure that the resolver will find a
          valid path (using a "logical OR" strategy), regardless of which
          particular algorithm(s) it supports, and thus be able to distinguish
          reliably between "all is in order" (validated data) and a
          downgrade-to-insecure attack (SERVFAIL).
      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Incompatible Use Cases">
        <t>
          The above rules are incompatible with certain use cases:
        </t>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <t>
              They are impractical to satisfy if DNS providers deployed in
              a multi-signer configuration are using different signing
              algorithms. By extension, it also means that multi-signer
              techniques cannot be employed to non-disruptively transfer a
              signed zone from one DNS provider to another if the providers use
              differing algorithms.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
              The rules further collide with the conflicting goal of
              pre-publishing the new trust anchor during a zone's algorithm
              rollover, while introducing the new algorithm into the zone only
              later in the process.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
              Furthermore, for online signers attempting to deploy multiple
              algorithms, producing signatures for several algorithms also
              imposes a significant computational burden, unless a selective
              algorithm negotiation mechanism is also developed.
            </t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          As the above rules present a severe limitation for these use cases,
          this document proposes to relax them in a way so that the set of
          signatures provided is still "large enough" to ensure reliable DNSSEC
          operation, while facilitating the above use cases.
